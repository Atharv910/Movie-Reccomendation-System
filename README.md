# Movie Recommendation System

I have used MovieLens and TMDB movie datasets and showcased implementation of 
five different types of recommender systems

1. Simple Recommender
2. Correlation Recommender
3. Content-Based Recommender
4. Collaborative Filtering (Model Based)
5. Hybrid Recommender

## Datasets

### Intructions

File 'read_and_analyze_movie_data_from_file' reads movie datasets from file and analyze the data
Each recommender implementation is in different file and can be run individually.
I have hard coded input for test output but in actual production, it will run by user input
